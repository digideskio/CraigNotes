<h2 style="border-top:0;margin-top:0;padding-top:0">How often are search results updated?</h2>
<p>
Whenever you look at a search, if its results are more than 15 minutes old then
we'll automatically ask Craigslist if there are any new ads which match your
search criteria.
</p>
<p>
When viewing search results, the top of the page contains a blurb about how old
the results are.  If the results are currently being updated, then it will say
"update in progress".  This text will <i>automatically</i> refresh when the new
results are available.  If new or updated ads were retrieved, then the text will
turn red to alert you to these new ads.
</p>


<h2>Do I need to login or create an account?</h2>
<p>
We ask our users to login so that we can save your searches and notes for you.
However, there's no need to create yet another account - you can login using
an <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>.
